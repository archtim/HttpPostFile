# HttpPostFile
This simple Visual C++ console program sends a binary file (e.g. jpg) to a REST endpoint. The code defines two structures, `FileCloser` and `InetCloser`, which are used to close file handles and internet handles respectively when they are no longer needed. The code also defines two functions, `WCharToChar` and `WriteToInternet`, which are used to convert wide-character strings to multibyte strings and write data to an internet handle respectivelyÂ³. Finally, the code defines a function called `PostFile` which takes four parameters: a pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the file name of the file to be uploaded, a pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the server name or IP address of the server that will receive the file, an integer that specifies the port number of the server, and a pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies the route on the server where the file will be uploaded.

The code includes a simple Python Flask endpoint that can be used for testing the code.
